## Security audit configuration for Rust dependencies
##
## `cargo audit` will read this file when run in the `contract` workspace.
## CI calls `cargo audit` with no extra flags; the severity policy and any
## exceptions are controlled here so they are explicit and reviewable.
##
## Fail CI on high/critical advisories only.
[output]
severity_threshold = "high"

## To ignore a specific advisory, add it under `[advisories]` and include
## a justification comment explaining why it is safe in this project.
##
## Example:
##
## [advisories]
## # RUSTSEC-0000-0000: <short description>
## # Reason: <why this is acceptable here, link to issue / PR / upstream discussion>
## ignore = [
##   "RUSTSEC-0000-0000",
## ]
